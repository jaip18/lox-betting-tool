    - 'x' interval of time to find how often a player hit a certain line

    - main.py: defines FastAPI app, takes in frontend requests
    - models.py: defines db tables using SQLAlchemy. Each class is a table
    - crud.py: contains functions to create, read, update, or delete records in db
    - database.py: handles connection to PostgreSQL, returns data to frontend
    - venv: python virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated
